* # weather

Prepare warm clothes, because temperature in next three days will be between blue and red with chances of apocalypses. But don't forget about sunglasses, because sun won't sunset pretty soon. Our scientist will talk more about this event in next news post, so stay toned.

* # sport
Sports aren't very popular in OHOL, becouse most people don't like stop working, but this workaholic behaviors can lead to occupational burnout. But you dont need worry about it anymore, becouse our scientists just discovered sport that need only wooden disc and two, or more players. It is called frisbee!

* # culture
Culture is heavily overlooked thing in ONOL, and we decided to change that. We want to support literature and culturar places like cinemas, theatres, dance parties and casinos, but we need your help. It doesn't matter if you can't particape in it, or you just don't want particape. We need you to stop ruining this place by stop stealing baskets from library, stop stealing popcorn from cinemas, stop stealing costumes from theatres, letting them to dance and by stop stealing bowls from casinos. Thanks for understanding.
